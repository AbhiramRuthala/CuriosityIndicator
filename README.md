# CuriosityIndicator
This is to provide a subjective look at curiosity tracking. We are able to use this to categorize the activities that people do, and if it's a high curiosity or low curiosity action. This is mainly for my research paper that is focusing on the Forgetting Curve and curiosity-based retention and education.
Hope you like it!
